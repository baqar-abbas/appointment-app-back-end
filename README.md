## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with the app, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ruby - The app is built on the Ruby programming language, so you'll need to have Ruby installed on your system. You can download Ruby from the official website.

Ruby on Rails - Rails is a web application framework built on Ruby. You'll need to have Rails installed on your system to run the app. You can install Rails using the following command in your terminal:

```sh
  gem install rails
```

PostgreSQL - PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system used by the app to store and manage data. You'll need to have PostgreSQL installed on your system to run the app.

Before running the app, you'll need to set up the database. To do this, run the following commands in your terminal:

  These are the steps:

1. Remove config/master.key and config/credentials.yml.enc if they exist.
2. Run in the terminal: EDITOR=code rails credentials:edit 
3. Close the editor that opens.
